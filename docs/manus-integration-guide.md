# Manus Proposal Generation Guide

This guide explains how to use Manus to generate a world-class, signable PDF proposal in minutes. By simply starting a new task and answering a series of guided questions, you can create a professional, branded proposal tailored to your client's needs.

## How to Start a New Proposal Task

To begin, simply start a new task with Manus and state your intent. For example:

> "I need to create a new proposal for a client."

Or, more specifically:

> "Let's create a proposal for ACME Corp for the 'Factory of the Future' project."

Manus will recognize your request and initiate the proposal generation workflow, guiding you through the following questions.

## The Guided Question Flow

Mans will ask you a series of questions to gather the necessary details for the proposal. Here is the exact flow you can expect:

### Part 1: Core Project Details

1.  **Client Company Name**: What is the full name of the client's company?
2.  **Client Location**: Where is the client located (e.g., City, State)?
3.  **Primary Client Contact**: Who is the main point of contact? (Full Name, Title)
4.  **Project Overview**: Please provide a brief, one-paragraph overview of the project's objectives and goals.
5.  **Total Project Investment**: What is the total investment for this project?

### Part 2: Pricing Display Options

1.  **Pricing Breakdown**: Would you like to show a detailed price breakdown by phase, or just the final total amount?
2.  **Travel Inclusion**: Should the proposal state that all travel expenses are included in the price?

### Part 3: Project Phases (This section will be repeated for each phase of the project)

*For each phase, Manus will ask:*

1.  **Phase Name**: What is the name of this phase (e.g., Discovery, Implementation)?
2.  **Phase Description**: Please describe the activities and goals of this phase in a short paragraph.
3.  **Phase Deliverables**: What are the key deliverables for this phase? (Please list 3-5 items)
4.  **Phase Amount**: What is the cost for this specific phase? (Only asked if you choose to show a pricing breakdown)

### Part 4: Final Touches

1.  **Your Contact Information**: Who from your team should be listed on the proposal? (Full Name, Title)
2.  **Date**: What is the date for this proposal?

## The Result: A Signable PDF

Once you have answered all the questions, Manus will automatically generate a professional, signable PDF proposal. Both you and your client will receive a copy of the final document, ready for signature.

This streamlined process ensures that every proposal is consistent, beautifully designed, and tailored to your client, allowing you to focus on winning the deal rather than on paperwork.
